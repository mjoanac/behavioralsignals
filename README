With this code you can replicate the experiments I showed on the slides, on detecting depression/ 
psychological distress in an in the wild contex.

This code requires the following packages:

Glob
Keras
Librosa
Matplotlib
Pandas
Pickle
Seaborn
Sklearn
Tensorflow

However, minor changes are required:

1: Go through the code and change all the absolute paths you find to match your dir structure.
2: Download a 25dim glove model and put in dir misc/
3: Create a .txt file with your data labels and save in data/labels.txt. The format should be:

File_1    label_1
File_2    label_2

(... etc.)

4: Put your raw wav data on data/wavs/
5: Put Oliver ASR raw output on data/asr/
6: Put Oliver Emotion descriptors raw output on dir data/emotions_frames/

After performing theses changes, all you need to do is run the scripts one by one, following their numbering order, 
and letting the previous finish before executing the next one.
